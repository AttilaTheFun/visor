// The SwiftPM dependencies Visor consumes through rules_swift_package_manager:
// AgentUI (the agent chat page and the navigation containers), swift-nio-ssh,
// and swift_sqlite (SQLite for the message cache, on every host). rspm reads
// Package.resolved for the pinned graph and generates one `@swiftpkg_<name>`
// repo per package.
